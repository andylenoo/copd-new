                Several factors can affect your COPD treatment's effectiveness:
                incorrect inhaler technique, missed doses, lifestyle factors
                like smoking, or your COPD may have progressed. Our 30-day
                program helps identify these issues and optimize your treatment
                plan for better results.

                While some patients notice improvements in breathing within
                days, optimal results typically develop over 2-4 weeks as your
                airways respond to treatment. Our program tracks your progress
                daily and adjusts your plan for the best outcomes.

                Yes, symptom variation is common with COPD. Factors like
                weather, activity level, and air quality can affect how you
                feel. Our program helps you identify your personal triggers and

                Absolutely. Research shows that combining proper medication with
                lifestyle modifications like structured exercise, breathing

                symptoms and quality of life. Our program guides you through
