    What is COPD?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-[40px] text-gray-700">
    COPD, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, is a progressive lung
    disease that makes it hard to breathe. It is typically caused by long-term
    exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from
    cigarette smoke. Other risk factors include air pollution, occupational
    dusts/chemicals, and genetic conditions like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-[40px] text-gray-700">
    The treatment of COPD focuses on relieving symptoms, improving quality of
    life, slowing disease progression, and preventing complications. While COPD
    is a chronic condition with no cure, a comprehensive treatment plan can help
    patients breathe better and stay active.

        Diagnosis
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-[80px] text-center text-gray-700">
        COPD is diagnosed using lung function tests such as spirometry, which
        measures how much air you can breathe in and out. Imaging tests (e.g.,
        chest X-ray or CT scan) and blood tests may also be used to rule out
        other conditions and assess severity.

        Treatment Overview
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-[80px] text-center text-gray-700">
        While there is no cure for COPD, treatment focuses on symptom relief,
        slowing progression, and improving daily function. This includes
        medications (bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids), pulmonary
        rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, lifestyle changes (especially quitting
        smoking), and, in advanced cases, surgery. Preventing flare-ups and
        infections with vaccinations is also vital.

        Living with COPD
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-[80px] text-center text-gray-700">
        Managing COPD involves daily care, including adhering to treatment
        plans, staying physically active within limits, maintaining a healthy
        diet, and monitoring for any changes in symptoms. Emotional and
        psychological support may also be necessary due to the impact of chronic
        illness.
